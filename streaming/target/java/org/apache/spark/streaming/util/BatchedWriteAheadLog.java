/**
 * A wrapper for a WriteAheadLog that batches records before writing data. Handles aggregation
 * during writes, and de-aggregation in the <code>readAll</code> method. The end consumer has to handle
 * de-aggregation after the <code>read</code> method. In addition, the <code>WriteAheadLogRecordHandle</code> returned
 * after the write will contain the batch of records rather than individual records.
 * <p>
 * When writing a batch of records, the <code>time</code> passed to the <code>wrappedLog</code> will be the timestamp
 * of the latest record in the batch. This is very important in achieving correctness. Consider the
 * following example:
 * We receive records with timestamps 1, 3, 5, 7. We use "log-1" as the filename. Once we receive
 * a clean up request for timestamp 3, we would clean up the file "log-1", and lose data regarding
 * 5 and 7.
 * <p>
 * This means the caller can assume the same write semantics as any other WriteAheadLog
 * implementation despite the batching in the background - when the write() returns, the data is
 * written to the WAL and is durable. To take advantage of the batching, the caller can write from
 * multiple threads, each of which will stay blocked until the corresponding data has been written.
 * <p>
 * All other methods of the WriteAheadLog interface will be passed on to the wrapped WriteAheadLog.
