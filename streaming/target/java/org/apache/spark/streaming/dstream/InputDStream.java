 * This is the abstract base class for all input streams. This class provides methods

 * Input streams that can generate RDDs from new data by running a service/thread only on
 * the driver node (that is, without running a receiver on worker nodes), can be
 * implemented by directly inheriting this InputDStream. For example,
 * FileInputDStream, a subclass of InputDStream, monitors an HDFS directory from the driver for
 * new files and generates RDDs with the new files. For implementing input streams
 * that requires running a receiver on the worker nodes, use
 * {@link org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.ReceiverInputDStream} as the parent class.
