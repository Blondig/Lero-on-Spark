   * Given a tree ensemble model, compute the importance of each feature.

   * <p>
   * For collections of trees, including boosting and bagging, Hastie et al.
   * propose to use the average of single tree importances across all trees in the ensemble.
   * <p>
   * This feature importance is calculated as follows:
   *  - Average over trees:
   *     - importance(feature j) = sum (over nodes which split on feature j) of the gain,
   *       where gain is scaled by the number of instances passing through node
   *     - Normalize importances for tree to sum to 1 (only if <code>perTreeNormalization</code> is <code>true</code>).
   *  - Normalize feature importance vector to sum to 1.

   *                     If -1, then numFeatures is set based on the max feature index in all trees.
   * @param perTreeNormalization By default this is set to <code>true</code> and it means that the importances
   *                             of each tree are normalized before being summed. If set to <code>false</code>,
   *                             the normalization is skipped.
