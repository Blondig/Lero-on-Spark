/**
 * Conduct the two-sided Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test for data sampled from a
 * continuous distribution. By comparing the largest difference between the empirical cumulative
 * distribution of the sample data and the theoretical distribution we can provide a test for the
 * the null hypothesis that the sample data comes from that theoretical distribution.
 * For more information on KS Test:
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">
 * Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Wikipedia)</a>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: We seek to implement the KS test with a minimal number of distributed
 * passes. We sort the RDD, and then perform the following operations on a per-partition basis:
 * calculate an empirical cumulative distribution value for each observation, and a theoretical
 * cumulative distribution value. We know the latter to be correct, while the former will be off by
 * a constant (how large the constant is depends on how many values precede it in other partitions).
 * However, given that this constant simply shifts the empirical CDF upwards, but doesn't
 * change its shape, and furthermore, that constant is the same within a given partition, we can
 * pick 2 values in each partition that can potentially resolve to the largest global distance.
 * Namely, we pick the minimum distance and the maximum distance. Additionally, we keep track of how
 * many elements are in each partition. Once these three values have been returned for every
 * partition, we can collect and operate locally. Locally, we can now adjust each distance by the
 * appropriate constant (the cumulative sum of number of elements in the prior partitions divided by
 * the data set size). Finally, we take the maximum absolute value, and this is the statistic.
