/**
 * Low-level status reporting APIs for monitoring job and stage progress.
 * <p>
 * These APIs intentionally provide very weak consistency semantics; consumers of these APIs should
 * be prepared to handle empty / missing information.  For example, a job's stage ids may be known
 * but the status API may not have any information about the details of those stages, so
 * <code>getStageInfo</code> could potentially return <code>null</code> for a valid stage id.
 * <p>
 * To limit memory usage, these APIs only provide information on recent jobs / stages.  These APIs
 * will provide information for the last <code>spark.ui.retainedStages</code> stages and
 * <code>spark.ui.retainedJobs</code> jobs.
 * <p>
 * @note This class's constructor should be considered private and may be subject to change.
