 * Stores the unique id() of the Python-side partitioning function so that it is incorporated into
 * equality comparisons.  Correctness requires that the id is a unique identifier for the
 * lifetime of the program (i.e. that it is not re-used as the id of a different partitioning
 * function).  This can be ensured by using the Python id() function and maintaining a reference
 * to the Python partitioning function so that its id() is not reused.
