/**
 * Implements policies and bookkeeping for sharing an adjustable-sized pool of memory between tasks.
 * <p>
 * Tries to ensure that each task gets a reasonable share of memory, instead of some task ramping up
 * to a large amount first and then causing others to spill to disk repeatedly.
 * <p>
 * If there are N tasks, it ensures that each task can acquire at least 1 / 2N of the memory
 * before it has to spill, and at most 1 / N. Because N varies dynamically, we keep track of the
 * set of active tasks and redo the calculations of 1 / 2N and 1 / N in waiting tasks whenever this
 * set changes. This is all done by synchronizing access to mutable state and using wait() and
 * notifyAll() to signal changes to callers. Prior to Spark 1.6, this arbitration of memory across
 * tasks was performed by the ShuffleMemoryManager.
 * <p>
 * param:  lock a {@link MemoryManager} instance to synchronize on
 * param:  memoryMode the type of memory tracked by this pool (on- or off-heap)
